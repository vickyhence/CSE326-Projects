        <h2>Why you should cast vote??</h2>
        <h3>Voting in India is a Constitutional right if one is a citizen over 18 years of age. However, that also makes
            it optional. It has been a tendency among voters, especially in the urban areas, to treat the voting day as
            a day of rest. While skipping the vote may not seem to cause any harm,the long-term consequences are
            disastrous.<br>Democracy has given people a powerful right- that is to VOTE. Voting is the fundamental basis
            of democracy’s ‘Of the people, for the people, and by the people’ slogan. Therefore, rather than enjoying it
            as a holiday, one must vote if he truly wants to contribute to the nation-building process and bring about a
            change. A Citizen should actually not need to find any reason to Vote. It must be done as a compulsive duty
            although there is no legal obligation to vote.
